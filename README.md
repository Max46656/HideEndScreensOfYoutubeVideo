# HideEndScreensOfYoutubeVideo

Although the ending screen of Youtube videos can provide some help,
there are often too many recommended videos or other elements that cause interference.
This script is designed to remove these interferences so that you can enjoy clean videos.

## Installation
1. Install Tampermonkey (Firefox, Chrome, Vivaldi)
2. Install [HideEndScreensOfYoutubeVideo](https://greasyfork.org/zh-TW/scripts/494754-%E9%9A%B1%E8%97%8Fyoutube%E7%89%87%E5%B0%BE%E7%95%AB%E9%9D%A2) (will load in userscript manager installed above)
3. Done
